# User Profile and Bootcamp Recommendation System

## Overview

This Python project is designed to create user profiles based on their skills and recommend suitable bootcamps accordingly. The project also keeps track of the number of registrations for each bootcamp, and it automatically removes a bootcamp from the list once it reaches its maximum capacity.

## Features

- **User Profile Creation**: The system takes the user's full name, email, and a list of skills to create a personalized profile.
- **Skill Validation**: The user's skills are validated against a predefined list of allowed skills.
- **Bootcamp Recommendation**: Based on the user's skills, the system recommends relevant bootcamps.
- **Registration Tracking**: The system tracks the number of registrants for each bootcamp, incrementing the count when a user registers.
- **Capacity Management**: Once a bootcamp reaches its maximum capacity, it is automatically removed from the available options.
